# The-Hard-Way
Learning python the hard way example scripts from https://learnpythonthehardway.org/

The majority of the from examples is not mine, except for some of the code from study drills. 

The codes in Example Code are mostly direct copies of of the code from https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex36.html

The code in ex36 is a text game that I'm currently working on.
